.SH NAME
randpass - generate a random password
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B randpass [-mravh] [-n<num>]
.SH AVAILABILITY
Mac OSX, Linux
.SH DESCRIPTION
randpass generates a string of characters that are suitable for use as passwords. By default, passwords are generated using letters,
symbols and numbers.
.SH MAC SPOOFING
You can use randpass if you want to change your MAC address to a random value. This can be useful if you want to use a public wifi network and don't want leak information about your hardware. This is an example of how to do that on a *nix machine:

First, close your existing wifi connection. Either do this manually or with a script. On a Mac running Mountain Lion you can use:

 $ sudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport -z

Then, change your MAC address using randpass. This command sets the MAC address of the en1 network connection:

 $ sudo ifconfig en1 ether $(randpass -m)

The en1 connection will typically be your WiFi, but you can check by just typing 'ifconfig'. You will then need to re-connect to the network. The network will treat your machine as a different piece of hardware and allocate you a new IP address. You MAC address will be reset if you reboot.
