# randpass

Generates a sequence of random characters, suitable for use as a password.

Options:

 -v Display the version number

 -h Display help text

 -a Restrict the password to alpha-numeric characters

 -n<num> Specify the number of characters in the password

 -r Force the use of the rand() call, rather than using /dev/random or /dev/urandom. Primarily useful for testing.

 -m Generate a random MAC address, e.g. 12:72:e2:b2:62:02

You can use randpass if you want to change your MAC address to a random value. This can be useful if you want to use a public wifi network and don't want leak information about your hardware. This is an example of how to do that on a Mac:

First, close your existing wifi connection:

     $ sudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport -z

Then, change your Mac address using randpass:

     $ sudo ifconfig en1 ether $(randpass -m)

You will then need to connect to the network. The network will treat your machine as a different piece of hardware and allocate you a new IP address. You MAC address will be reset if you reboot.
