Generates a sequence of random characters, suitable for use as a password.

Options:
 -v Display the version number
 -h Display help text
 -a Restrict the password to alpha-numeric characters
 -n<num> Specify the number of characters in the password
 -r Force the use of the rand() call, rather than using /dev/random or /dev/urandom. Primarily useful for testing.
